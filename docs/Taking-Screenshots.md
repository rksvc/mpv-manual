Screenshots of the currently played file can be taken using the
'screenshot' input mode command, which is by default bound to the `s`
key. Files named `mpv-shotNNNN.jpg` will be saved in the working
directory, using the first available number - no files will be
overwritten. In pseudo-GUI mode, the screenshot will be saved somewhere
else. See [PSEUDO GUI MODE](Pseudo-GUI-Mode.md).

A screenshot will usually contain the unscaled video contents at the end
of the video filter chain and subtitles. By default, `S` takes
screenshots without subtitles, while `s` includes subtitles.

Unlike with MPlayer, the `screenshot` video filter is not required. This
filter was never required in mpv, and has been removed.
