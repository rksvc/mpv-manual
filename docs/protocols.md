title: Protocols
---

`mpv://...`

> mpv protocol. This is used for starting mpv from URL handler. The
> protocol is stripped and the rest is passed to the player as a normal
> open argument. Only safe network protocols are allowed to be opened
> this way.

`http://...`, `https://`, ...

> Many network protocols are supported, but the protocol prefix must
> always be specified. mpv will never attempt to guess whether a
> filename is actually a network address. A protocol prefix is always
> required.
>
> Note that not all prefixes are documented here. Undocumented prefixes
> are either aliases to documented protocols, or are just redirections
> to protocols implemented and documented in FFmpeg.
>
> `data:` is supported, but needs to be in the format `data://`. This is
> done to avoid ambiguity with filenames. You can also prefix it with
> `lavf://` or `ffmpeg://`.

`ytdl://...`

> By default, the youtube-dl hook script only looks at http(s) URLs.
> Prefixing an URL with `ytdl://` forces it to be always processed by
> the script. This can also be used to invoke special youtube-dl
> functionality like playing a video by ID or invoking search.
>
> Keep in mind that you can't pass youtube-dl command line options by
> this, and you have to use `--ytdl-raw-options` instead.

`-`

> Play data from stdin.

`smb://PATH`

> Play a path from Samba share. (Requires FFmpeg support.)

`bd://[title][/device]` `--bluray-device=PATH`

> Play a Blu-ray disc. Since libbluray 1.0.1, you can read from ISO
> files by passing them to `--bluray-device`.
>
> `title` can be: `longest` or `first` (selects the default playlist);
> `mpls/<number>` (selects \<number\>.mpls playlist); `<number>` (select
> playlist with the same index). mpv will list the available playlists
> on loading.
>
> `bluray://` is an alias.

`dvd://[title][/device]` `--dvd-device=PATH`

> Play a DVD. DVD menus are not supported. If no title is given, the
> longest title is auto-selected. Without `--dvd-device`, it will
> probably try to open an actual optical drive, if available and
> implemented for the OS.
>
> `dvdnav://` is an old alias for `dvd://` and does exactly the same
> thing.

`dvb://[cardnumber@]channel` `--dvbin-...`

> Digital TV via DVB. (Linux only.)

`mf://[@listfile|filemask|glob|printf-format]` `--mf-...`

> Play a series of images as video.
>
> If the URL path begins with `@`, it is interpreted as the path to a
> file containing a list of image paths separated by newlines. If the
> URL path contains `,`, it is interpreted as a list of image paths
> separated by `,`. If the URL path does not contain `%` and if on POSIX
> platforms, is interpreted as a glob, and `*` is automatically appended
> if it was not specified. Otherwise, the printf sequences `%[.][NUM]d`,
> where `NUM` is one, two, or three decimal digits, and `%%` and are
> interpreted. For example, `mf://image-%d.jpg` plays files like
> `image-1.jpg`, `image-2.jpg` and `image-10.jpg`, provided that there
> are no big gaps between the files.

`cdda://[device]` `--cdda-device=PATH`

> Play CD. You can select a specific range of tracks to play by using
> the `--start` and `--end` options and specifying chapters. Navigating
> forwards and backwards through tracks can also be done by navigating
> through chapters (`PGUP` and `PGDOWN` in the default keybinds).
>
> <div class="admonition" markdown="1">
>
> Example
>
>     mpv cdda:// --start=#4 --end=#6
>
> This will start from track 4, play track 5, and then end.
>
> </div>

`lavf://...`

> Access any FFmpeg libavformat protocol. Basically, this passed the
> string after the `//` directly to libavformat.

`av://type:options`

> This is intended for using libavdevice inputs. `type` is the
> libavdevice demuxer name, and `options` is the (pseudo-)filename
> passed to the demuxer.
>
> <div class="admonition" markdown="1">
>
> Example
>
>     mpv av://v4l2:/dev/video0 --profile=low-latency --untimed
>
> This plays video from the first v4l input with nearly the lowest
> latency possible. It's a good replacement for the removed `tv://`
> input. Using `--untimed` is a hack to output a captured frame
> immediately, instead of respecting the input framerate. (There may be
> better ways to handle this in the future.)
>
> </div>
>
> `avdevice://` is an alias.

`file://PATH`

> A local path as URL. Might be useful in some special use-cases. Note
> that `PATH` itself should start with a third `/` to make the path an
> absolute path.

`appending://PATH`

> Play a local file, but assume it's being appended to. This is useful
> for example for files that are currently being downloaded to disk.
> This will block playback, and stop playback only if no new data was
> appended after a timeout of about 2 seconds.
>
> Using this is still a bit of a bad idea, because there is no way to
> detect if a file is actually being appended, or if it's still written.
> If you're trying to play the output of some program, consider using a
> pipe (`something | mpv -`). If it really has to be a file on disk, use
> tail to make it wait forever, e.g. `tail -f -c +0 file.mkv | mpv -`.

`fd://123`

> Read data from the given file descriptor (for example 123). This is
> similar to piping data to stdin via `-`, but can use an arbitrary file
> descriptor. mpv may modify some file descriptor properties when the
> stream layer "opens" it.

`fdclose://123`

> Like `fd://`, but the file descriptor is closed after use. When using
> this you need to ensure that the same fd URL will only be used once.

`edl://[edl specification as in edl-mpv.rst]`

> Stitch together parts of multiple files and play them.

`slice://start[-end]@URL`

> Read a slice of a stream.
>
> `start` and `end` represent a byte range and accept suffixes such as
> `KiB` and `MiB`. `end` is optional.
>
> if `end` starts with `+`, it is considered as offset from `start`.
>
> Only works with seekable streams.
>
> Examples:
>
>     mpv slice://1g-2g@cap.ts
>
>     This starts reading from cap.ts after seeking 1 GiB, then
>     reads until reaching 2 GiB or end of file.
>
>     mpv slice://1g-+2g@cap.ts
>
>     This starts reading from cap.ts after seeking 1 GiB, then
>     reads until reaching 3 GiB or end of file.
>
>     mpv slice://100m@appending://cap.ts
>
>     This starts reading from cap.ts after seeking 100MiB, then
>     reads until end of file.

`null://`

> Simulate an empty file. If opened for writing, it will discard all
> data. The `null` demuxer will specifically pass autoprobing if this
> protocol is used (while it's not automatically invoked for empty
> files).

`memory://data`

> Use the `data` part as source data.

`hex://data`

> Like `memory://`, but the string is interpreted as hexdump.
