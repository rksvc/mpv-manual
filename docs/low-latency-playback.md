title: Low Latency Playback
---

mpv is optimized for normal video playback, meaning it actually tries to
buffer as much data as it seems to make sense. This will increase
latency. Reducing latency is possible only by specifically disabling
features which increase latency.

The builtin `low-latency` profile tries to apply some of the options
which can reduce latency. You can use `--profile=low-latency` to apply
all of them. You can list the contents with `--show-profile=low-latency`
(some of the options are quite obscure, and may change every mpv
release).

Be aware that some of the options can reduce playback quality.

Most latency is actually caused by inconvenient timing behavior. You can
disable this with `--untimed`, but it will likely break, unless the
stream has no audio, and the input feeds data to the player at a
constant rate.

Another common problem is with MJPEG streams. These do not signal the
correct framerate. Using `--untimed` or
`--correct-pts=no --container-fps-override=60` might help.

For livestreams, data can build up due to pausing the stream, due to
slightly lower playback rate, or "buffering" pauses. If the demuxer
cache is enabled, these can be skipped manually. The experimental
`drop-buffers` command can be used to discard any buffered data, though
it's very disruptive.

In some cases, manually tuning TCP buffer sizes and such can help to
reduce latency.

Additional options that can be tried:

- `--opengl-glfinish=yes`, can reduce buffering in the graphics driver
- `--opengl-swapinterval=0`, same
- `--vo=xv`, same
- without audio `--framedrop=no --speed=1.01` may help for live sources
  (results can be mixed)
