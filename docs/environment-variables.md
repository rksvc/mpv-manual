title: Environment Variables
---

There are a number of environment variables that can be used to control
the behavior of mpv.

`HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`

:   Used to determine mpv config directory. If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not
    set, `$HOME/.config/mpv` is used.

    `$HOME/.mpv` is always added to the list of config search paths with
    a lower priority.

`MPV_HOME`

:   Directory where mpv looks for user settings. Overrides `HOME`, and
    mpv will try to load the config file as `$MPV_HOME/mpv.conf`.

`MPV_VERBOSE` (see also `-v` and `--msg-level`)

:   Set the initial verbosity level across all message modules (default:
    0). This is an integer, and the resulting verbosity corresponds to
    the number of `--v` options passed to the command line.

`MPV_LEAK_REPORT`

:   If set to `1`, enable internal talloc leak reporting. If set to
    another value, disable leak reporting.

`LADSPA_PATH`

:   Specifies the search path for LADSPA plugins. If it is unset, fully
    qualified path names must be used.

`DISPLAY`

:   Standard X11 display name to use.

FFmpeg:

:   This library accesses various environment variables. However, they
    are not centrally documented, and documenting them is not our job.
    Therefore, this list is incomplete.

    Notable environment variables:

    `http_proxy`

    :   URL to proxy for `http://` and `https://` URLs.

    `no_proxy`

    :   List of domain patterns for which no proxy should be used. List
        entries are separated by `,`. Patterns can include `*`.

libdvdcss:

:   

    `DVDCSS_CACHE`

    :   Specify a directory in which to store title key values. This
        will speed up descrambling of DVDs which are in the cache. The
        `DVDCSS_CACHE` directory is created if it does not exist, and a
        subdirectory is created named after the DVD's title or
        manufacturing date. If `DVDCSS_CACHE` is not set or is empty,
        libdvdcss will use the default value which is `${HOME}/.dvdcss/`
        under Unix and the roaming application data directory
        (`%APPDATA%`) under Windows. The special value "off" disables
        caching.

    `DVDCSS_METHOD`

    :   Sets the authentication and decryption method that libdvdcss
        will use to read scrambled discs. Can be one of `title`, `key`
        or `disc`.

        key

        :   is the default method. libdvdcss will use a set of
            calculated player keys to try to get the disc key. This can
            fail if the drive does not recognize any of the player keys.

        disc

        :   is a fallback method when key has failed. Instead of using
            player keys, libdvdcss will crack the disc key using a brute
            force algorithm. This process is CPU intensive and requires
            64 MB of memory to store temporary data.

        title

        :   is the fallback when all other methods have failed. It does
            not rely on a key exchange with the DVD drive, but rather
            uses a crypto attack to guess the title key. On rare cases
            this may fail because there is not enough encrypted data on
            the disc to perform a statistical attack, but on the other
            hand it is the only way to decrypt a DVD stored on a hard
            disc, or a DVD with the wrong region on an RPC2 drive.

    `DVDCSS_RAW_DEVICE`

    :   Specify the raw device to use. Exact usage will depend on your
        operating system, the Linux utility to set up raw devices is
        raw(8) for instance. Please note that on most operating systems,
        using a raw device requires highly aligned buffers: Linux
        requires a 2048 bytes alignment (which is the size of a DVD
        sector).

    `DVDCSS_VERBOSE`

    :   Sets the libdvdcss verbosity level.

        0
        :   Outputs no messages at all.

        1
        :   Outputs error messages to stderr.

        2
        :   Outputs error messages and debug messages to stderr.

    `DVDREAD_NOKEYS`

    :   Skip retrieving all keys on startup. Currently disabled.

    `HOME`

    :   FIXME: Document this.
