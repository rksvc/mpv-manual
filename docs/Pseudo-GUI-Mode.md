mpv has no official GUI, other than the OSC ([ON SCREEN
CONTROLLER](On-Screen-Controller.md)), which is not a full GUI and is not
meant to be. However, to compensate for the lack of expected GUI
behavior, mpv will in some cases start with some settings changed to
behave slightly more like a GUI mode.

Currently this happens only in the following cases:

- if started using the `mpv.desktop` file on Linux (e.g. started from
  menus or file associations provided by desktop environments)
- if started from explorer.exe on Windows (technically, if it was
  started on Windows, and all of the stdout/stderr/stdin handles are
  unset)
- started out of the bundle on macOS
- if you manually use `--player-operation-mode=pseudo-gui` on the
  command line

This mode applies options from the builtin profile `builtin-pseudo-gui`,
but only if these haven't been set in the user's config file or on the
command line, which is the main difference to using
`--profile=builtin-pseudo-gui`.

The profile is currently defined as follows:

    [builtin-pseudo-gui]
    terminal=no
    force-window=yes
    idle=once
    screenshot-directory=~~desktop/

The `pseudo-gui` profile exists for compatibility. The options in the
`pseudo-gui` profile are applied unconditionally. In addition, the
profile makes sure to enable the pseudo-GUI mode, so that
`--profile=pseudo-gui` works like in older mpv releases:

    [pseudo-gui]
    player-operation-mode=pseudo-gui

Warning

Currently, you can extend the `pseudo-gui` profile in the config file
the normal way. This is deprecated. In future mpv releases, the behavior
might change, and not apply your additional settings, and/or use a
different profile name.
