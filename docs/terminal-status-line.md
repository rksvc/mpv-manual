title: Terminal status line
---

During playback, mpv shows the playback status on the terminal. It looks
like something like this:

> `AV: 00:03:12 / 00:24:25 (13%) A-V: -0.000`

The status line can be overridden with the `--term-status-msg` option.

The following is a list of things that can show up in the status line.
Input properties, that can be used to get the same information manually,
are also listed.

- `AV:` or `V:` (video only) or `A:` (audio only)
- The current time position in `HH:MM:SS` format (`playback-time`
  property)
- The total file duration (absent if unknown) (`duration` property)
- Playback speed, e.g. `x2.0`. Only visible if the speed is not normal.
  This is the user-requested speed, and not the actual speed (usually
  they should be the same, unless playback is too slow). (`speed`
  property.)
- Playback percentage, e.g. `(13%)`. How much of the file has been
  played. Normally calculated out of playback position and duration, but
  can fallback to other methods (like byte position) if these are not
  available. (`percent-pos` property.)
- The audio/video sync as `A-V:  0.000`. This is the difference between
  audio and video time. Normally it should be 0 or close to 0. If it's
  growing, it might indicate a playback problem. (`avsync` property.)
- Total A/V sync change, e.g. `ct: -0.417`. Normally invisible. Can show
  up if there is audio "missing", or not enough frames can be dropped.
  Usually this will indicate a problem. (`total-avsync-change`
  property.)
- Encoding state in `{...}`, only shown in encoding mode.
- Display sync state. If display sync is active (`display-sync-active`
  property), this shows `DS: 2.500/13`, where the first number is
  average number of vsyncs per video frame (e.g. 2.5 when playing 24Hz
  videos on 60Hz screens), which might jitter if the ratio doesn't round
  off, or there are mistimed frames (`vsync-ratio`), and the second
  number of estimated number of vsyncs which took too long
  (`vo-delayed-frame-count` property). The latter is a heuristic, as
  it's generally not possible to determine this with certainty.
- Dropped frames, e.g. `Dropped: 4`. Shows up only if the count is
  not 0. Can grow if the video framerate is higher than that of the
  display, or if video rendering is too slow. May also be incremented on
  "hiccups" and when the video frame couldn't be displayed on time.
  (`frame-drop-count` property.) If the decoder drops frames, the number
  of decoder-dropped frames is appended to the display as well, e.g.:
  `Dropped: 4/34`. This happens only if decoder frame dropping is
  enabled with the `--framedrop` options. (`decoder-frame-drop-count`
  property.)
- Cache state, e.g. `Cache:  2s/134KB`. Visible if the stream cache is
  enabled. The first value shows the amount of video buffered in the
  demuxer in seconds, the second value shows the estimated size of the
  buffered amount in kilobytes. (`demuxer-cache-duration` and
  `demuxer-cache-state` properties.)
