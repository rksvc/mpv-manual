Normally **mpv** returns 0 as exit code after finishing playback
successfully. If errors happen, the following exit codes can be
returned:

> 
>
> 1
> :   Error initializing mpv. This is also returned if unknown options
>     are passed to mpv.
>
> 2
> :   The file passed to mpv couldn't be played. This is somewhat fuzzy:
>     currently, playback of a file is considered to be successful if
>     initialization was mostly successful, even if playback fails
>     immediately after initialization.
>
> 3
> :   There were some files that could be played, and some files which
>     couldn't (using the definition of success from above).
>
> 4
> :   Quit due to a signal, Ctrl+c in a VO window (by default), or from
>     the default quit key bindings in encoding mode.

Note that quitting the player manually will always lead to exit code 0,
overriding the exit code that would be returned normally. Also, the
`quit` input command can take an exit code: in this case, that exit code
is returned.
