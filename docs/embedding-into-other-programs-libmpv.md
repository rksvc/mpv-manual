title: Embedding into Other Programs (libmpv)
---

mpv can be embedded into other programs as video/audio playback backend.
The recommended way to do so is using libmpv. See `include/mpv/client.h`
in the mpv source code repository. This provides a C API. Bindings for
other languages might be available (see wiki).

Since libmpv merely allows access to underlying mechanisms that can
control mpv, further documentation is spread over a few places:

- <https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/include/mpv/client.h>
- <https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options>
- <https://mpv.io/manual/master/#list-of-input-commands>
- <https://mpv.io/manual/master/#properties>
