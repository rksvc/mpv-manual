title: Properties
---

Properties are used to set mpv options during runtime, or to query
arbitrary information. They can be manipulated with the
`set`/`add`/`cycle` commands, and retrieved with `show-text`, or
anything else that uses property expansion. (See [Property
Expansion](property-expansion.md).)

If an option is referenced, the property will normally take/return
exactly the same values as the option. In these cases, properties are
merely a way to change an option at runtime.

Note that many properties are unavailable at startup. See [Details on
the script initialization and
lifecycle](../lua-scripting.md#details-on-the-script-initialization-and-lifecycle).
