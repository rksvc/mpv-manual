title: List of events
---

This is a partial list of events. This section describes what
`mpv_event_to_node()` returns, and which is what scripting APIs and the
JSON IPC sees. Note that the C API has separate C-level declarations
with `mpv_event`, which may be slightly different.

Note that events are asynchronous: the player core continues running
while events are delivered to scripts and other clients. In some cases,
you can use hooks to enforce synchronous execution.

All events can have the following fields:

`event`

:   Name as the event (as returned by `mpv_event_name()`).

`id`

:   The `reply_userdata` field (opaque user value). If `reply_userdata`
    is 0, the field is not added.

`error`

:   Set to an error string (as returned by `mpv_error_string()`). This
    field is missing if no error happened, or the event type does not
    report error. Most events leave this unset.

This list uses the event name field value, and the C API symbol in
brackets:

`start-file` (`MPV_EVENT_START_FILE`)

:   Happens right before a new file is loaded. When you receive this,
    the player is loading the file (or possibly already done with it).

    This has the following fields:

    `playlist_entry_id`

    :   Playlist entry ID of the file being loaded now.

`end-file` (`MPV_EVENT_END_FILE`)

:   Happens after a file was unloaded. Typically, the player will load
    the next file right away, or quit if this was the last file.

    The event has the following fields:

    `reason`

    :   Has one of these values:

        `eof`

        :   The file has ended. This can (but doesn't have to) include
            incomplete files or broken network connections under
            circumstances.

        `stop`

        :   Playback was ended by a command.

        `quit`

        :   Playback was ended by sending the quit command.

        `error`

        :   An error happened. In this case, an `error` field is present
            with the error string.

        `redirect`

        :   Happens with playlists and similar. Details see
            `MPV_END_FILE_REASON_REDIRECT` in the C API.

        `unknown`

        :   Unknown. Normally doesn't happen, unless the Lua API is out
            of sync with the C API. (Likewise, it could happen that your
            script gets reason strings that did not exist yet at the
            time your script was written.)

    `playlist_entry_id`

    :   Playlist entry ID of the file that was being played or attempted
        to be played. This has the same value as the `playlist_entry_id`
        field in the corresponding `start-file` event.

    `file_error`

    :   Set to mpv error string describing the approximate reason why
        playback failed. Unset if no error known. (In Lua scripting,
        this value was set on the `error` field directly. This is
        deprecated since mpv 0.33.0. In the future, this `error` field
        will be unset for this specific event.)

    `playlist_insert_id`

    :   If loading ended, because the playlist entry to be played was
        for example a playlist, and the current playlist entry is
        replaced with a number of other entries. This may happen at
        least with MPV_END_FILE_REASON_REDIRECT (other event types may
        use this for similar but different purposes in the future). In
        this case, playlist_insert_id will be set to the playlist entry
        ID of the first inserted entry, and playlist_insert_num_entries
        to the total number of inserted playlist entries. Note this in
        this specific case, the ID of the last inserted entry is
        playlist_insert_id+num-1. Beware that depending on
        circumstances, you may observe the new playlist entries before
        seeing the event (e.g. reading the "playlist" property or
        getting a property change notification before receiving the
        event). If this is 0 in the C API, this field isn't added.

    `playlist_insert_num_entries`

    :   See playlist_insert_id. Only present if playlist_insert_id is
        present.

`file-loaded` (`MPV_EVENT_FILE_LOADED`)

:   Happens after a file was loaded and begins playback.

`seek` (`MPV_EVENT_SEEK`)

:   Happens on seeking. (This might include cases when the player seeks
    internally, even without user interaction. This includes e.g.
    segment changes when playing ordered chapters Matroska files.)

`playback-restart` (`MPV_EVENT_PLAYBACK_RESTART`)

:   Start of playback after seek or after file was loaded.

`shutdown` (`MPV_EVENT_SHUTDOWN`)

:   Sent when the player quits, and the script should terminate.
    Normally handled automatically. See [Details on the script
    initialization and
    lifecycle](../lua-scripting.md#details-on-the-script-initialization-and-lifecycle).

`log-message` (`MPV_EVENT_LOG_MESSAGE`)

:   Receives messages enabled with `mpv_request_log_messages()` (Lua:
    `mp.enable_messages`).

    This contains, in addition to the default event fields, the
    following fields:

    `prefix`

    :   The module prefix, identifies the sender of the message. This is
        what the terminal player puts in front of the message text when
        using the `--v` option, and is also what is used for
        `--msg-level`.

    `level`

    :   The log level as string. See `msg.log` for possible log level
        names. Note that later versions of mpv might add new levels or
        remove (undocumented) existing ones.

    `text`

    :   The log message. The text will end with a newline character.
        Sometimes it can contain multiple lines.

    Keep in mind that these messages are meant to be hints for humans.
    You should not parse them, and prefix/level/text of messages might
    change any time.

`hook`

:   The event has the following fields:

    `hook_id`

    :   ID to pass to `mpv_hook_continue()`. The Lua scripting wrapper
        provides a better API around this with `mp.add_hook()`.

`get-property-reply` (`MPV_EVENT_GET_PROPERTY_REPLY`)

:   See C API.

`set-property-reply` (`MPV_EVENT_SET_PROPERTY_REPLY`)

:   See C API.

`command-reply` (`MPV_EVENT_COMMAND_REPLY`)

:   This is one of the commands for which the `` `error `` field is
    meaningful.

    JSON IPC and Lua and possibly other backends treat this specially
    and may not pass the actual event to the user. See C API.

    The event has the following fields:

    `result`

    :   The result (on success) of any `mpv_node` type, if any.

`client-message` (`MPV_EVENT_CLIENT_MESSAGE`)

:   Lua and possibly other backends treat this specially and may not
    pass the actual event to the user.

    The event has the following fields:

    `args`

    :   Array of strings with the message data.

`video-reconfig` (`MPV_EVENT_VIDEO_RECONFIG`)

:   Happens on video output or filter reconfig.

`audio-reconfig` (`MPV_EVENT_AUDIO_RECONFIG`)

:   Happens on audio output or filter reconfig.

`property-change` (`MPV_EVENT_PROPERTY_CHANGE`)

:   Happens when a property that is being observed changes value.

    The event has the following fields:

    `name`

    :   The name of the property.

    `data`

    :   The new value of the property.

The following events also happen, but are deprecated: `idle`, `tick` Use
`mpv_observe_property()` (Lua: `mp.observe_property()`) instead.
