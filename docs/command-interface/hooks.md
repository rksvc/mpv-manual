title: Hooks
---

Hooks are synchronous events between player core and a script or
similar. This applies to client API (including the Lua scripting
interface). Normally, events are supposed to be asynchronous, and the
hook API provides an awkward and obscure way to handle events that
require stricter coordination. There are no API stability guarantees
made. Not following the protocol exactly can make the player freeze
randomly. Basically, nobody should use this API.

The C API is described in the header files. The Lua API is described in
the Lua section.

Before a hook is actually invoked on an API clients, it will attempt to
return new values for all observed properties that were changed before
the hook. This may make it easier for an application to set defined
"barriers" between property change notifications by registering hooks.
(That means these hooks will have an effect, even if you do nothing and
make them continue immediately.)

The following hooks are currently defined:

`on_load`

:   Called when a file is to be opened, before anything is actually
    done. For example, you could read and write the
    `stream-open-filename` property to redirect an URL to something else
    (consider support for streaming sites which rarely give the user a
    direct media URL), or you could set per-file options with by setting
    the property `file-local-options/<option name>`. The player will
    wait until all hooks are run.

    Ordered after `start-file` and before `playback-restart`.

`on_load_fail`

:   Called after after a file has been opened, but failed to. This can
    be used to provide a fallback in case native demuxers failed to
    recognize the file, instead of always running before the native
    demuxers like `on_load`. Demux will only be retried if
    `stream-open-filename` was changed. If it fails again, this hook is
    <span id="not">not</span>\_ called again, and loading definitely
    fails.

    Ordered after `on_load`, and before `playback-restart` and
    `end-file`.

`on_preloaded`

:   Called after a file has been opened, and before tracks are selected
    and decoders are created. This has some usefulness if an API users
    wants to select tracks manually, based on the set of available
    tracks. It's also useful to initialize `--lavfi-complex` in a
    specific way by API, without having to "probe" the available streams
    at first.

    Note that this does not yet apply default track selection. Which
    operations exactly can be done and not be done, and what information
    is available and what is not yet available yet, is all subject to
    change.

    Ordered after `on_load_fail` etc. and before `playback-restart`.

`on_unload`

:   Run before closing a file, and before actually uninitializing
    everything. It's not possible to resume playback in this state.

    Ordered before `end-file`. Will also happen in the error case (then
    after `on_load_fail`).

`on_before_start_file`

:   Run before a `start-file` event is sent. (If any client changes the
    current playlist entry, or sends a quit command to the player, the
    corresponding event will not actually happen after the hook
    returns.) Useful to drain property changes before a new file is
    loaded.

`on_after_end_file`

:   Run after an `end-file` event. Useful to drain property changes
    after a file has finished.
