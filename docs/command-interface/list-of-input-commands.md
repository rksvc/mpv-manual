title: List of Input Commands
---

Commands with parameters have the parameter name enclosed in `<` / `>`.
Don't add those to the actual command. Optional arguments are enclosed
in `[` / `]`. If you don't pass them, they will be set to a default
value.

Remember to quote string arguments in input.conf (see [Flat command
syntax](flat-command-syntax.md)).

##### Playback Control

`seek <target> [<flags>]`

:   Change the playback position. By default, seeks by a relative amount
    of seconds.

    The second argument consists of flags controlling the seek mode:

    relative (default)

    :   Seek relative to current position (a negative value seeks
        backwards).

    absolute

    :   Seek to a given time (a negative value starts from the end of
        the file).

    absolute-percent

    :   Seek to a given percent position.

    relative-percent

    :   Seek relative to current position in percent.

    keyframes

    :   Always restart playback at keyframe boundaries (fast).

    exact

    :   Always do exact/hr/precise seeks (slow).

    Multiple flags can be combined, e.g.: `absolute+keyframes`.

    By default, `keyframes` is used for `relative`, `relative-percent`,
    and `absolute-percent` seeks, while `exact` is used for `absolute`
    seeks.

    Before mpv 0.9, the `keyframes` and `exact` flags had to be passed
    as 3rd parameter (essentially using a space instead of `+`). The 3rd
    parameter is still parsed, but is considered deprecated.

    This is a scalable command. See the documentation of `nonscalable`
    input command prefix in [Input Command
    Prefixes](input-command-prefixes.md) for details.

`revert-seek [<flags>]`

:   Undoes the `seek` command, and some other commands that seek (but
    not necessarily all of them). Calling this command once will jump to
    the playback position before the seek. Calling it a second time
    undoes the `revert-seek` command itself. This only works within a
    single file.

    The first argument is optional, and can change the behavior:

    mark

    :   Mark the current time position. The next normal `revert-seek`
        command will seek back to this point, no matter how many seeks
        happened since last time.

    mark-permanent

    :   If set, mark the current position, and do not change the mark
        position before the next `revert-seek` command that has `mark`
        or `mark-permanent` set (or playback of the current file ends).
        Until this happens, `revert-seek` will always seek to the marked
        point. This flag cannot be combined with `mark`.

    Using it without any arguments gives you the default behavior.

`sub-seek <skip> [<flags>]`

:   Change video and audio position such that the subtitle event after
    `<skip>` subtitle events is displayed. For example, `sub-seek 1`
    skips to the next subtitle, `sub-seek -1` skips to the previous
    subtitles, and `sub-seek 0` seeks to the beginning of the current
    subtitle.

    This is similar to `sub-step`, except that it seeks video and audio
    instead of adjusting the subtitle delay.

    Secondary argument:

    primary (default)

    :   Seeks through the primary subtitles.

    secondary

    :   Seeks through the secondary subtitles.

    For embedded subtitles (like with Matroska), this works only with
    subtitle events that have already been displayed, or are within a
    short prefetch range. See [Cache](../options.md#cache) for details on how to
    control the available prefetch range.

`frame-step [<frames>] [<flags>]`

:   Go forward or backwards by a given amount of frames. If `<frames>`
    is omitted, the value is assumed to be `1`.

    The second argument consists of flags controlling the frameskip
    mode:

    play (default)

    :   Play the video forward by the desired amount of frames and then
        pause. This only works with a positive value (i.e. frame
        stepping forwards).

    seek

    :   Perform a very exact seek that attempts to seek by the desired
        amount of frames. If `<frames>` is `-1`, this will go exactly to
        the previous frame.

    mute

    :   The same as `play` but mutes the audio stream if there is any
        during the duration of the frame step.

    Note that the default frameskip mode, play, is more accurate but can
    be slow depending on how many frames you are skipping (i.e. skipping
    forward 100 frames will play 100 frames of video before stopping).
    This mode only works when going forwards. Frame stepping back always
    performs a seek.

    When using seek mode, this can still be very slow (it tries to be
    precise, not fast), and sometimes fails to behave as expected. How
    well this works depends on whether precise seeking works correctly
    (e.g. see the `--hr-seek-demuxer-offset` option). Video filters or
    other video post-processing that modifies timing of frames (e.g.
    deinterlacing) should usually work, but might make framestepping
    silently behave incorrectly in corner cases. Using
    `--hr-seek-framedrop=no` should help, although it might make precise
    seeking slower. Also if the video is VFR, framestepping using seeks
    will probably not work correctly except for the `-1` case.

    This does not work with audio-only playback.

`frame-back-step`

:   Calls `frame-step` with a value of `-1` and the `seek` flag.

    This does not work with audio-only playback.

`stop [<flags>]`

:   Stop playback and clear playlist. With default settings, this is
    essentially like `quit`. Useful for the client API: playback can be
    stopped without terminating the player.

    The first argument is optional, and supports the following flags:

    keep-playlist

    :   Do not clear the playlist.

##### Property Manipulation

`set <name> <value>`

:   Set the given property or option to the given value.

`del <name>`

:   Delete the given property. Most properties cannot be deleted.

`add <name> [<value>]`

:   Add the given value to the property or option. On overflow or
    underflow, clamp the property to the maximum. If `<value>` is
    omitted, assume `1`.

    Whether or not key-repeat is enabled by default depends on the
    property. Currently properties with continuous values are repeatable
    by default (like `volume`), while discrete values are not (like
    `osd-level`).

    This is a scalable command. See the documentation of `nonscalable`
    input command prefix in [Input Command
    Prefixes](input-command-prefixes.md) for details.

`multiply <name> <value>`

:   Similar to `add`, but multiplies the property or option with the
    numeric value.

`cycle <name> [<value>]`

:   Cycle the given property or option. The second argument can be `up`
    or `down` to set the cycle direction. On overflow, set the property
    back to the minimum, on underflow set it to the maximum. If `up` or
    `down` is omitted, assume `up`.

    Whether or not key-repeat is enabled by default depends on the
    property. Currently properties with continuous values are repeatable
    by default (like `volume`), while discrete values are not (like
    `osd-level`).

    This is a scalable command. See the documentation of `nonscalable`
    input command prefix in [Input Command
    Prefixes](input-command-prefixes.md) for details.

`cycle-values [<"!reverse">] <property> <value1> [<value2> [...]]`

:   Cycle through a list of values. Each invocation of the command will
    set the given property to the next value in the list. The command
    will use the current value of the property/option, and use it to
    determine the current position in the list of values. Once it has
    found it, it will set the next value in the list (wrapping around to
    the first item if needed).

    This command has a variable number of arguments, and cannot be used
    with named arguments.

    The special argument `!reverse` can be used to cycle the value list
    in reverse. The only advantage is that you don't need to reverse the
    value list yourself when adding a second key binding for cycling
    backwards.

`change-list <name> <operation> <value>`

:   This command changes list options as described in [List
    Options](../usage.md#list-options). The `<name>` parameter is the normal option
    name, while `<operation>` is the suffix or action used on the
    option.

    Some operations take no value, but the command still requires the
    value parameter. In these cases, the value must be an empty string.

    <div class="admonition" markdown="1">

    Example

    `change-list glsl-shaders append file.glsl`

    Add a filename to the `glsl-shaders` list. The command line
    equivalent is `--glsl-shaders-append=file.glsl` or alternatively
    `--glsl-shader=file.glsl`.

    </div>

##### Playlist Manipulation

`playlist-next [<flags>]`

:   Go to the next entry on the playlist.

    First argument:

    weak (default)

    :   If the last file on the playlist is currently played, do
        nothing.

    force

    :   Terminate playback if there are no more files on the playlist.

`playlist-prev [<flags>]`

:   Go to the previous entry on the playlist.

    First argument:

    weak (default)

    :   If the first file on the playlist is currently played, do
        nothing.

    force

    :   Terminate playback if the first file is being played.

`playlist-next-playlist`

:   Go to the next entry on the playlist with a different
    `playlist-path`.

`playlist-prev-playlist`

:   Go to the first of the previous entries on the playlist with a
    different `playlist-path`.

`playlist-play-index <integer|current|none>`

:   Start (or restart) playback of the given playlist index. In addition
    to the 0-based playlist entry index, it supports the following
    values:

    \<current\>

    :   The current playlist entry (as in `playlist-current-pos`) will
        be played again (unload and reload). If none is set, playback is
        stopped. (In corner cases, `playlist-current-pos` can point to a
        playlist entry even if playback is currently inactive,

    \<none\>

    :   Playback is stopped. If idle mode (`--idle`) is enabled, the
        player will enter idle mode, otherwise it will exit.

    This command is similar to `loadfile` in that it only manipulates
    the state of what to play next, without waiting until the current
    file is unloaded, and the next one is loaded.

    Setting `playlist-pos` or similar properties can have a similar
    effect to this command. However, it's more explicit, and guarantees
    that playback is restarted if for example the new playlist entry is
    the same as the previous one.

`loadfile <url> [<flags> [<index> [<options>]]]`

:   Load the given file or URL and play it. Technically, this is just a
    playlist manipulation command (which either replaces the playlist or
    adds an entry to it). Actual file loading happens independently. For
    example, a `loadfile` command that replaces the current file with a
    new one returns before the current file is stopped, and the new file
    even begins loading.

    Second argument:

    \<replace\> (default)

    :   Stop playback of the current file, and play the new file
        immediately.

    \<append\>

    :   Append the file to the playlist.

    \<append-play\>

    :   Append the file, and if nothing is currently playing, start
        playback. (Always starts with the added file, even if the
        playlist was not empty before running this command.)

    \<insert-next\>

    :   Insert the file into the playlist, directly after the current
        entry.

    \<insert-next-play\>

    :   Insert the file next, and if nothing is currently playing, start
        playback. (Always starts with the added file, even if the
        playlist was not empty before running this command.)

    \<insert-at\>

    :   Insert the file into the playlist, at the index given in the
        third argument.

    \<insert-at-play\>

    :   Insert the file at the index given in the third argument, and if
        nothing is currently playing, start playback. (Always starts
        with the added file, even if the playlist was not empty before
        running this command.)

    The third argument is an insertion index, used only by the
    `insert-at` and `insert-at-play` actions. When used with those
    actions, the new item will be inserted at the index position in the
    playlist, or appended to the end if index is less than 0 or greater
    than the size of the playlist. This argument will be ignored for all
    other actions. This argument is added in mpv 0.38.0.

    The fourth argument is a list of options and values which should be
    set while the file is playing. It is of the form
    `opt1=value1,opt2=value2,..`. When using the client API, this can be
    a `MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP` (or a Lua table), however the values
    themselves must be strings currently. These options are set during
    playback, and restored to the previous value at end of playback (see
    [Per-File Options](../usage.md#per-file-options)).

    <div class="warning" markdown="1">

    <div class="title" markdown="1">

    Warning

    </div>

    Since mpv 0.38.0, an insertion index argument is added as the third
    argument. This breaks all existing uses of this command which make
    use of the argument to include the list of options to be set while
    the file is playing. To address this problem, the third argument now
    needs to be set to -1 if the fourth argument needs to be used.

    </div>

`loadlist <url> [<flags> [<index>]]`

:   Load the given playlist file or URL (like `--playlist`).

    Second argument:

    \<replace\> (default)

    :   Stop playback and replace the internal playlist with the new
        one.

    \<append\>

    :   Append the new playlist at the end of the current internal
        playlist.

    \<append-play\>

    :   Append the new playlist, and if nothing is currently playing,
        start playback. (Always starts with the new playlist, even if
        the internal playlist was not empty before running this
        command.)

    \<insert-next\>

    :   Insert the new playlist into the current internal playlist,
        directly after the current entry.

    \<insert-next-play\>

    :   Insert the new playlist, and if nothing is currently playing,
        start playback. (Always starts with the new playlist, even if
        the internal playlist was not empty before running this
        command.)

    \<insert-at\>

    :   Insert the new playlist at the index given in the third
        argument.

    \<insert-at-play\>

    :   Insert the new playlist at the index given in the third
        argument, and if nothing is currently playing, start playback.
        (Always starts with the new playlist, even if the internal
        playlist was not empty before running this command.)

    The third argument is an insertion index, used only by the
    `insert-at` and `insert-at-play` actions. When used with those
    actions, the new playlist will be inserted at the index position in
    the internal playlist, or appended to the end if index is less than
    0 or greater than the size of the internal playlist. This argument
    will be ignored for all other actions.

`playlist-clear`

:   Clear the playlist, except the currently played file.

`playlist-remove <index>`

:   Remove the playlist entry at the given index. Index values start
    counting with 0. The special value `current` removes the current
    entry. Note that removing the current entry also stops playback and
    starts playing the next entry.

`playlist-move <index1> <index2>`

:   Move the playlist entry at index1, so that it takes the place of the
    entry index2. (Paradoxically, the moved playlist entry will not have
    the index value index2 after moving if index1 was lower than index2,
    because index2 refers to the target entry, not the index the entry
    will have after moving.)

`playlist-shuffle`

:   Shuffle the playlist. This is similar to what is done on start if
    the `--shuffle` option is used.

`playlist-unshuffle`

:   Attempt to revert the previous `playlist-shuffle` command. This
    works only once (multiple successive `playlist-unshuffle` commands
    do nothing). May not work correctly if new recursive playlists have
    been opened since a `playlist-shuffle` command.

##### Track Manipulation

`sub-add <url> [<flags> [<title> [<lang>]]]`

:   Load the given subtitle file or stream. By default, it is selected
    as current subtitle after loading.

    The `flags` argument is one of the following values:

    \<select\>

    > Select the subtitle immediately (default).

    \<auto\>

    > Don't select the subtitle. (Or in some special situations, let the
    > default stream selection mechanism decide.)

    \<cached\>

    > Select the subtitle. If a subtitle with the same filename was
    > already added, that one is selected, instead of loading a
    > duplicate entry. (In this case, title/language are ignored, and if
    > the was changed since it was loaded, these changes won't be
    > reflected.)

    Additionally the following flags can be added with a `+`:

    \<hearing-impaired\>

    > Marks the track as suitable for the hearing impaired.

    \<visual-impaired\>

    > Marks the track as suitable for the visually impaired.

    \<forced\>

    > Marks the track as forced.

    \<default\>

    > Marks the track as default.

    \<attached-picture\> (only for `video-add`)

    > Marks the track as an attached picture, same as `albumart`
    > argument for `` `video-add ``.

    The `title` argument sets the track title in the UI.

    The `lang` argument sets the track language, and can also influence
    stream selection with `flags` set to `auto`.

`sub-remove [<id>]`

:   Remove the given subtitle track. If the `id` argument is missing,
    remove the current track. (Works on external subtitle files only.)

`sub-reload [<id>]`

:   Reload the given subtitle tracks. If the `id` argument is missing,
    reload the current track. (Works on external subtitle files only.)

    This works by unloading and re-adding the subtitle track.

`sub-step <skip> [<flags>]`

:   Change subtitle timing such, that the subtitle event after the next
    `<skip>` subtitle events is displayed. `<skip>` can be negative to
    step backwards.

    Secondary argument:

    primary (default)

    :   Steps through the primary subtitles.

    secondary

    :   Steps through the secondary subtitles.

`audio-add <url> [<flags> [<title> [<lang>]]]`

:   Load the given audio file. See `sub-add` command.

`audio-remove [<id>]`

:   Remove the given audio track. See `sub-remove` command.

`audio-reload [<id>]`

:   Reload the given audio tracks. See `sub-reload` command.

`video-add <url> [<flags> [<title> [<lang> [<albumart>]]]]`

:   Load the given video file. See `sub-add` command for common options.

    `albumart` (`MPV_FORMAT_FLAG`)

    :   If enabled, mpv will load the given video as album art.

`video-remove [<id>]`

:   Remove the given video track. See `sub-remove` command.

`video-reload [<id>]`

:   Reload the given video tracks. See `sub-reload` command.

`rescan-external-files [<mode>]`

:   Rescan external files according to the current `--sub-auto`,
    `--audio-file-auto` and `--cover-art-auto` settings. This can be
    used to auto-load external files *after* the file was loaded.

    The `mode` argument is one of the following:

    \<reselect\> (default)

    :   Select the default audio and subtitle streams, which typically
        selects external files with the highest preference. (The
        implementation is not perfect, and could be improved on
        request.)

    \<keep-selection\>

    :   Do not change current track selections.

##### Text Manipulation

`print-text <text>`

:   Print text to stdout. The string can contain properties (see
    [Property Expansion](property-expansion.md)). Take care to put the
    argument in quotes.

`expand-text <text>`

:   Property-expand the argument and return the expanded string. This
    can be used only through the client API or from a script using
    `mp.command_native`. (see [Property
    Expansion](property-expansion.md)).

`expand-path <text>`

:   Expand a path's double-tilde placeholders into a platform-specific
    path. As `expand-text`, this can only be used through the client API
    or from a script using `mp.command_native`.

    <div class="admonition" markdown="1">

    Example

    `mp.osd_message(mp.command_native({"expand-path", "~~home/"}))`

    This line of Lua would show the location of the user's mpv
    configuration directory on the OSD.

    </div>

`normalize-path <filename>`

:   Return a canonical representation of the path `filename` by
    converting it to an absolute path, removing consecutive slashes,
    removing `.` components, resolving `..` components, and converting
    slashes to backslashes on Windows. Symlinks are not resolved unless
    the platform is Unix-like and one of the path components is `..`. If
    `filename` is a URL, it is returned unchanged. This can only be used
    through the client API or from a script using `mp.command_native`.

    <div class="admonition" markdown="1">

    Example

    `mp.osd_message(mp.command_native({"normalize-path", "/foo//./bar"}))`

    This line of Lua prints "/foo/bar" on the OSD.

    </div>

`escape-ass <text>`

:   Modify `text` so that commands and functions that interpret ASS
    tags, such as `osd-overlay` and `mp.create_osd_overlay`, will
    display it verbatim, and return it. This can only be used through
    the client API or from a script using `mp.command_native`.

    <div class="admonition" markdown="1">

    Example

    `mp.osd_message(mp.command_native({"escape-ass", "foo {bar}"}))`

    This line of Lua prints "foo \\bar}" on the OSD.

    </div>

##### Configuration Commands

`apply-profile <name> [<mode>]`

:   Apply the contents of a named profile. This is like using
    `profile=name` in a config file, except you can map it to a key
    binding to change it at runtime.

    The mode argument:

    `apply`

    :   Apply the profile. Default if the argument is omitted.

    `restore`

    :   Restore options set by a previous `apply-profile` command for
        this profile. Only works if the profile has `profile-restore`
        set to a relevant mode. Prints a warning if nothing could be
        done. See [Runtime profiles](../configuration-files.md#runtime-profiles) for details.

`load-config-file <filename>`

:   Load a configuration file, similar to the `--include` option. If the
    file was already included, its previous options are not reset before
    it is reparsed.

`write-watch-later-config`

:   Write the resume config file that the `quit-watch-later` command
    writes, but continue playback normally.

`delete-watch-later-config [<filename>]`

:   Delete any existing resume config file that was written by
    `quit-watch-later` or `write-watch-later-config`. If a filename is
    specified, then the deleted config is for that file; otherwise, it
    is the same one as would be written by `quit-watch-later` or
    `write-watch-later-config` in the current circumstance.

##### OSD Commands

`show-text <text> [<duration>|-1 [<level>]]`

:   Show text on the OSD. The string can contain properties, which are
    expanded as described in [Property Expansion](property-expansion.md).
    This can be used to show playback time, filename, and so on.
    `no-osd` has no effect on this command.

    \<duration\>

    :   The time in ms to show the message for. By default, it uses the
        same value as `--osd-duration`.

    \<level\>

    :   The minimum OSD level to show the text at (see `--osd-level`).

`show-progress`

:   Show the progress bar, the elapsed time and the total duration of
    the file on the OSD. `no-osd` has no effect on this command.

`overlay-add <id> <x> <y> <file> <offset> <fmt> <w> <h> <stride> <dw> <dh>`

:   Add an OSD overlay sourced from raw data. This might be useful for
    scripts and applications controlling mpv, and which want to display
    things on top of the video window.

    Overlays are usually displayed in screen resolution, but with some
    VOs, the resolution is reduced to that of the video's. You can read
    the `osd-width` and `osd-height` properties. At least with `--vo-xv`
    and anamorphic video (such as DVD), `osd-par` should be read as
    well, and the overlay should be aspect-compensated.

    This has the following named arguments. The order of them is not
    guaranteed, so you should always call them with named arguments, see
    [Named arguments](named-arguments.md).

    `id` is an integer between 0 and 63 identifying the overlay element.
    The ID can be used to add multiple overlay parts, update a part by
    using this command with an already existing ID, or to remove a part
    with `overlay-remove`. Using a previously unused ID will add a new
    overlay, while reusing an ID will update it.

    `x` and `y` specify the position where the OSD should be displayed.

    `file` specifies the file the raw image data is read from. It can be
    either a numeric UNIX file descriptor prefixed with `@` (e.g. `@4`),
    or a filename. The file will be mapped into memory with `mmap()`,
    copied, and unmapped before the command returns (changed in mpv
    0.18.1).

    It is also possible to pass a raw memory address for use as bitmap
    memory by passing a memory address as integer prefixed with an `&`
    character. Passing the wrong thing here will crash the player. This
    mode might be useful for use with libmpv. The `offset` parameter is
    simply added to the memory address (since mpv 0.8.0, ignored
    before).

    `offset` is the byte offset of the first pixel in the source file.
    (The current implementation always mmap's the whole file from
    position 0 to the end of the image, so large offsets should be
    avoided. Before mpv 0.8.0, the offset was actually passed directly
    to `mmap`, but it was changed to make using it easier.)

    `fmt` is a string identifying the image format. Currently, only
    `bgra` is defined. This format has 4 bytes per pixels, with 8 bits
    per component. The least significant 8 bits are blue, and the most
    significant 8 bits are alpha (in little endian, the components are
    B-G-R-A, with B as first byte). This uses premultiplied alpha: every
    color component is already multiplied with the alpha component. This
    means the numeric value of each component is equal to or smaller
    than the alpha component. (Violating this rule will lead to
    different results with different VOs: numeric overflows resulting
    from blending broken alpha values is considered something that
    shouldn't happen, and consequently implementations don't ensure that
    you get predictable behavior in this case.)

    `w`, `h`, and `stride` specify the size of the overlay. `w` is the
    visible width of the overlay, while `stride` gives the width in
    bytes in memory. In the simple case, and with the `bgra` format,
    `stride==4*w`. In general, the total amount of memory accessed is
    `stride * h`. (Technically, the minimum size would be
    `stride * (h - 1) + w * 4`, but for simplicity, the player will
    access all `stride * h` bytes.)

    `dw` and `dh` specify the (optional) display size of the overlay.
    The overlay visible portion of the overlay (`w` and `h`) is scaled
    to in display to `dw` and `dh`. If parameters are not present, the
    values for `w` and `h` are used.

    Note

    </div>

    Before mpv 0.18.1, you had to do manual "double buffering" when
    updating an overlay by replacing it with a different memory buffer.
    Since mpv 0.18.1, the memory is simply copied and doesn't reference
    any of the memory indicated by the command's arguments after the
    command returns. If you want to use this command before mpv 0.18.1,
    reads the old docs to see how to handle this correctly.

    </div>

`overlay-remove <id>`

:   Remove an overlay added with `overlay-add` and the same ID. Does
    nothing if no overlay with this ID exists.

`osd-overlay`

:   Add/update/remove an OSD overlay.

    (Although this sounds similar to `overlay-add`, `osd-overlay` is for
    text overlays, while `overlay-add` is for bitmaps. Maybe
    `overlay-add` will be merged into `osd-overlay` to remove this
    oddity.)

    You can use this to add text overlays in ASS format. ASS has
    advanced positioning and rendering tags, which can be used to render
    almost any kind of vector graphics.

    This command accepts the following parameters:

    `id`

    :   Arbitrary integer that identifies the overlay. Multiple overlays
        can be added by calling this command with different `id`
        parameters. Calling this command with the same `id` replaces the
        previously set overlay.

        There is a separate namespace for each libmpv client (i.e. IPC
        connection, script), so IDs can be made up and assigned by the
        API user without conflicting with other API users.

        If the libmpv client is destroyed, all overlays associated with
        it are also deleted. In particular, connecting via
        `--input-ipc-server`, adding an overlay, and disconnecting will
        remove the overlay immediately again.

    `format`

    :   String that gives the type of the overlay. Accepts the following
        values (HTML rendering of this is broken, view the generated
        manpage instead, or the raw RST source):

        `ass-events`

        :   The `data` parameter is a string. The string is split on the
            newline character. Every line is turned into the `Text` part
            of a `Dialogue` ASS event. Timing is unused (but behavior of
            timing dependent ASS tags may change in future mpv
            versions).

            Note that it's better to put multiple lines into `data`,
            instead of adding multiple OSD overlays.

            This provides 2 ASS `Styles`. `OSD` contains the text style
            as defined by the current `--osd-...` options. `Default` is
            similar, and contains style that `OSD` would have if all
            options were set to the default.

            In addition, the `res_x` and `res_y` options specify the
            value of the ASS `PlayResX` and `PlayResY` header fields. If
            `res_y` is set to 0, `PlayResY` is initialized to an
            arbitrary default value (but note that the default for this
            command is 720, not 0). If `res_x` is set to 0, `PlayResX`
            is set based on `res_y` such that a virtual ASS pixel has a
            square pixel aspect ratio.

        `none`

        :   Special value that causes the overlay to be removed. Most
            parameters other than `id` and `format` are mostly ignored.

    `data`

    :   String defining the overlay contents according to the `format`
        parameter.

    `res_x`, `res_y`

    :   Used if `format` is set to `ass-events` (see description there).
        Optional, defaults to 0/720.

    `z`

    :   The Z order of the overlay. Optional, defaults to 0.

        Note that Z order between different overlays of different
        formats is static, and cannot be changed (currently, this means
        that bitmap overlays added by `overlay-add` are always on top of
        the ASS overlays added by `osd-overlay`). In addition, the
        builtin OSD components are always below any of the custom OSD.
        (This includes subtitles of any kind as well as text rendered by
        `show-text`.)

        It's possible that future mpv versions will randomly change how
        Z order between different OSD formats and builtin OSD is
        handled.

    `hidden`

    :   If set to true, do not display this (default: false).

    `compute_bounds`

    :   If set to true, attempt to determine bounds and write them to
        the command's result value as `x0`, `x1`, `y0`, `y1` rectangle
        (default: false). If the rectangle is empty, not known, or
        somehow degenerate, it is not set. `x1`/`y1` is the coordinate
        of the bottom exclusive corner of the rectangle.

        The result value may depend on the VO window size, and is based
        on the last known window size at the time of the call. This
        means the results may be different from what is actually
        rendered.

        For `ass-events`, the result rectangle is recomputed to
        `PlayRes` coordinates (`res_x`/`res_y`). If window size is not
        known, a fallback is chosen.

        You should be aware that this mechanism is very inefficient, as
        it renders the full result, and then uses the bounding box of
        the rendered bitmap list (even if `hidden` is set). It will
        flush various caches. Its results also depend on the used libass
        version.

        This feature is experimental, and may change in some way again.

    Note

    Always use named arguments (`mpv_command_node()`). Lua scripts

    this command directly.

    </div>

##### Input and Keybind Commands

`mouse <x> <y> [<button> [<mode>]]`

:   Send a mouse event with given coordinate (`<x>`, `<y>`).

    Second argument:

    \<button\>

    :   The button number of clicked mouse button. This should be one of
        0-19. If `<button>` is omitted, only the position will be
        updated.

    Third argument:

    \<single\> (default)

    :   The mouse event represents regular single click.

    \<double\>

    :   The mouse event represents double-click.

`keypress <name> [<scale>]`

:   Send a key event through mpv's input handler, triggering whatever
    behavior is configured to that key. `name` uses the `input.conf`
    naming scheme for keys and modifiers. `scale` is used to scale
    numerical change effected by the bound command (same mechanism as
    precise scrolling). Useful for the client API: key events can be
    sent to libmpv to handle internally.

`keydown <name>`

:   Similar to `keypress`, but sets the `KEYDOWN` flag so that if the
    key is bound to a repeatable command, it will be run repeatedly with
    mpv's key repeat timing until the `keyup` command is called.

`keyup [<name>]`

:   Set the `KEYUP` flag, stopping any repeated behavior that had been
    triggered. `name` is optional. If `name` is not given or is an empty
    string, `KEYUP` will be set on all keys. Otherwise, `KEYUP` will
    only be set on the key specified by `name`.

`keybind <name> <cmd> [<comment>]`

:   Binds a key to an input command. `cmd` must be a complete command
    containing all the desired arguments and flags. Both `name` and
    `cmd` use the `input.conf` naming scheme. `comment` is an optional
    string which can be read as the `comment` entry of `input-bindings`.
    This is primarily useful for the client API.

`enable-section <name> [<flags>]`

:   This command is deprecated, except for mpv-internal uses.

    Enable all key bindings in the named input section.

    The enabled input sections form a stack. Bindings in sections on the
    top of the stack are preferred to lower sections. This command puts
    the section on top of the stack. If the section was already on the
    stack, it is implicitly removed beforehand. (A section cannot be on
    the stack more than once.)

    The `flags` parameter can be a combination (separated by `+`) of the
    following flags:

    \<exclusive\>

    :   All sections enabled before the newly enabled section are
        disabled. They will be re-enabled as soon as all exclusive
        sections above them are removed. In other words, the new section
        shadows all previous sections.

    \<allow-hide-cursor\>

    :   This feature can't be used through the public API.

    \<allow-vo-dragging\>

    :   Same.

`disable-section <name>`

:   This command is deprecated, except for mpv-internal uses.

    Disable the named input section. Undoes `enable-section`.

`define-section <name> <contents> [<flags>]`

:   This command is deprecated, except for mpv-internal uses.

    Create a named input section, or replace the contents of an already
    existing input section. The `contents` parameter uses the same
    syntax as the `input.conf` file (except that using the section
    syntax in it is not allowed), including the need to separate
    bindings with a newline character.

    If the `contents` parameter is an empty string, the section is
    removed.

    The section with the name `default` is the normal input section.

    In general, input sections have to be enabled with the
    `enable-section` command, or they are ignored.

    The last parameter has the following meaning:

    \<default\> (also used if parameter omitted)

    :   Use a key binding defined by this section only if the user
        hasn't already bound this key to a command.

    \<force\>

    :   Always bind a key. (The input section that was made active most
        recently wins if there are ambiguities.)

    This command can be used to dispatch arbitrary keys to a script or a
    client API user. If the input section defines `script-binding`
    commands, it is also possible to get separate events on key up/down,
    and relatively detailed information about the key state. The special
    key name `unmapped` can be used to match any unmapped key.

`load-input-conf <filename>`

:   Load an input configuration file, similar to the `--input-conf`
    option. If the file was already included, its previous bindings are
    not reset before it is reparsed.

##### Execution Commands

`run <command> [<arg1> [<arg2> [...]]]`

:   Run the given command. Unlike in MPlayer/mplayer2 and earlier
    versions of mpv (0.2.x and older), this doesn't call the shell.
    Instead, the command is run directly, with each argument passed
    separately. Each argument is expanded like in [Property
    Expansion](property-expansion.md).

    This command has a variable number of arguments, and cannot be used
    with named arguments.

    The program is run in a detached way. mpv doesn't wait until the
    command is completed, but continues playback right after spawning
    it.

    To get the old behavior, use `/bin/sh` and `-c` as the first two
    arguments.

    <div class="admonition" markdown="1">

    Example

    `run "/bin/sh" "-c" "echo ${title} > /tmp/playing"`

    This is not a particularly good example, because it doesn't handle
    escaping, and a specially prepared file might allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary shell commands. It is recommended to write a small
    shell script, and call that with `run`.

    </div>

`subprocess`

:   Similar to `run`, but gives more control about process execution to
    the caller, and does not detach the process.

    You can avoid blocking until the process terminates by running this
    command asynchronously. (For example `mp.command_native_async()` in
    Lua scripting.)

    This has the following named arguments. The order of them is not
    guaranteed, so you should always call them with named arguments, see
    [Named arguments](named-arguments.md).

    `args` (`MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY[MPV_FORMAT_STRING]`)

    :   Array of strings with the command as first argument, and
        subsequent command line arguments following. This is just like
        the `run` command argument list.

        The first array entry is either an absolute path to the
        executable, or a filename with no path components, in which case
        the executable is searched in the directories in the `PATH`
        environment variable. On Unix, this is equivalent to
        `posix_spawnp` and `execvp` behavior.

    `playback_only` (`MPV_FORMAT_FLAG`)

    :   Boolean indicating whether the process should be killed when
        playback of the current playlist entry terminates (optional,
        default: true). If enabled, stopping playback will automatically
        kill the process, and you can't start it outside of playback.

    `capture_size` (`MPV_FORMAT_INT64`)

    :   Integer setting the maximum number of stdout plus stderr bytes
        that can be captured (optional, default: 64MB). If the number of
        bytes exceeds this, capturing is stopped. The limit is per
        captured stream.

    `capture_stdout` (`MPV_FORMAT_FLAG`)

    :   Capture all data the process outputs to stdout and return it
        once the process ends (optional, default: no).

    `capture_stderr` (`MPV_FORMAT_FLAG`)

    :   Same as `capture_stdout`, but for stderr.

    `detach` (`MPV_FORMAT_FLAG`)

    :   Whether to run the process in detached mode (optional, default:
        no). In this mode, the process is run in a new process session,
        and the command does not wait for the process to terminate. If
        neither `capture_stdout` nor `capture_stderr` have been set to
        true, the command returns immediately after the new process has
        been started, otherwise the command will read as long as the
        pipes are open.

    `env` (`MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY[MPV_FORMAT_STRING]`)

    :   Set a list of environment variables for the new process
        (default: empty). If an empty list is passed, the environment of
        the mpv process is used instead. (Unlike the underlying OS
        mechanisms, the mpv command cannot start a process with empty
        environment. Fortunately, that is completely useless.) The
        format of the list is as in the `execle()` syscall. Each string
        item defines an environment variable as in `NAME=VALUE`.

        On Lua, you may use `utils.get_env_list()` to retrieve the
        current environment if you e.g. simply want to add a new
        variable.

    `stdin_data` (`MPV_FORMAT_STRING`)

    :   Feed the given string to the new process' stdin. Since this is a
        string, you cannot pass arbitrary binary data. If the process
        terminates or closes the pipe before all data is written, the
        remaining data is silently discarded. Probably does not work on
        win32.

    `passthrough_stdin` (`MPV_FORMAT_FLAG`)

    :   If enabled, wire the new process' stdin to mpv's stdin (default:
        no). Before mpv 0.33.0, this argument did not exist, but the
        behavior was as if this was set to true.

    The command returns the following result (as `MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP`):

    `status` (`MPV_FORMAT_INT64`)

    :   Typically this is the process exit code (0 or positive) if the
        process terminates normally, or negative for other errors
        (failed to start, terminated by mpv, and others). The meaning of
        negative values is undefined, other than meaning error (and does
        not correspond to OS low level exit status values).

        On Windows, it can happen that a negative return value is
        returned even if the process terminates normally, because the
        win32 `UINT` exit code is assigned to an `int` variable before
        being set as `int64_t` field in the result map. This might be
        fixed later.

    `stdout` (`MPV_FORMAT_BYTE_ARRAY`)

    :   Captured stdout stream, limited to `capture_size`.

    `stderr` (`MPV_FORMAT_BYTE_ARRAY`)

    :   Same as `stdout`, but for stderr.

    `error_string` (`MPV_FORMAT_STRING`)

    :   Empty string if the process terminated normally. The string
        `killed` if the process was terminated in an unusual way. The
        string `init` if the process could not be started.

        On Windows, `killed` is only returned when the process has been
        killed by mpv as a result of `playback_only` being set to true.

    `killed_by_us` (`MPV_FORMAT_FLAG`)

    :   Whether the process has been killed by mpv, for example as a
        result of `playback_only` being set to true, aborting the
        command (e.g. by `mp.abort_async_command()`), or if the player
        is about to exit.

    Note that the command itself will always return success as long as
    the parameters are correct. Whether the process could be spawned or
    whether it was somehow killed or returned an error status has to be
    queried from the result value.

    This command can be asynchronously aborted via API. Also see
    [Asynchronous command details](asynchronous-command-details.md). Only
    the `run` command can start processes in a truly detached way.

    <div class="note" markdown="1">

    <div class="title" markdown="1">

        local r = mp.command_native({

        })
        if r.status == 0 then
            print("result: " .. r.stdout)
        end

    This is a fairly useless Lua example, which demonstrates how to run
    a process in a blocking manner, and retrieving its stdout output.

    </div>

`quit [<code>]`

:   Exit the player. If an argument is given, it's used as process exit
    code.

`quit-watch-later [<code>]`

:   Exit player, and store current playback position. Playing that file
    later will seek to the previous position on start. The (optional)
    argument is exactly as in the `quit` command. See [RESUMING
    PLAYBACK](../resuming-playback.md).

##### Scripting Commands

`script-message [<arg1> [<arg2> [...]]]`

:   Send a message to all clients, and pass it the following list of
    arguments. What this message means, how many arguments it takes, and
    what the arguments mean is fully up to the receiver and the sender.
    Every client receives the message, so be careful about name clashes
    (or use `script-message-to`).

    This command has a variable number of arguments, and cannot be used
    with named arguments.

`script-message-to <target> [<arg1> [<arg2> [...]]]`

:   Same as `script-message`, but send it only to the client named
    `<target>`. Each client (scripts etc.) has a unique name. For
    example, Lua scripts can get their name via `mp.get_script_name()`.
    Note that client names only consist of alphanumeric characters and
    `_`.

    This command has a variable number of arguments, and cannot be used
    with named arguments.

`script-binding <name> [<arg>]`

:   Invoke a script-provided key binding. This can be used to remap key
    bindings provided by external Lua scripts.

    `<name>` is the name of the binding. `<arg>` is a user-provided
    arbitrary string which can be used to provide extra information.

    It can optionally be prefixed with the name of the script, using `/`
    as separator, e.g. `script-binding scriptname/bindingname`. Note
    that script names only consist of alphanumeric characters and `_`.

    For completeness, here is how this command works internally. The
    details could change any time. On any matching key event,
    `script-message-to` or `script-message` is called (depending on
    whether the script name is included), with the following arguments
    in string format:

    1.  The string `key-binding`.
    2.  The name of the binding (as established above).
    3.  The key state as string (see below).
    4.  The key name (since mpv 0.15.0).
    5.  The text the key would produce, or empty string if not
        applicable.
    6.  The scale of the key, such as the ones produced by `WHEEL_*`
        keys. The scale is 1 if the key is nonscalable.
    7.  The user-provided string `<arg>`, or empty string if the
        argument is not used.

    The 5th argument is only set if no modifiers are present (using the
    shift key with a letter is normally not emitted as having a
    modifier, and results in upper case text instead, but some backends
    may mess up).

    The key state consists of 3 characters:

    1.  One of `d` (key was pressed down), `u` (was released), `r` (key
        is still down, and was repeated; only if key repeat is enabled
        for this binding), `p` (key was pressed; happens if up/down
        can't be tracked).
    2.  Whether the event originates from the mouse, either `m` (mouse
        button) or `-` (something else).
    3.  Whether the event results from a cancellation (e.g. the key is
        logically released but not physically released), either `c`
        (canceled) or `-` (something else). Not all types of
        cancellations set this flag.

    Future versions can add more arguments and more key state characters
    to support more input peculiarities.

    This is a scalable command. See the documentation of `nonscalable`
    input command prefix in [Input Command
    Prefixes](input-command-prefixes.md) for details.

`load-script <filename>`

:   Load a script, similar to the `--script` option. Whether this waits
    for the script to finish initialization or not changed multiple
    times, and the future behavior is left undefined.

    On success, returns a `mpv_node` with a `client_id` field set to the
    return value of the `mpv_client_id()` API call of the newly created
    script handle.

##### Screenshot Commands

`screenshot [<flags>]`

:   Take a screenshot.

    Multiple flags are available (some can be combined with `+`):

    \<video\>

    :   Save the video image in its original resolution, without OSD or
        subtitles. This is the default when no flag is specified, and it
        does not need to be explicitly added when combined with other
        flags.

    \<scaled\>

    :   Save the video image in the current playback resolution.

    \<subtitles\> (default)

    :   Save the video image with subtitles. Some video outputs may
        still include the OSD in the output under certain circumstances.

    \<osd\>

    :   Save the video image with OSD.

    \<window\>

    :   Save the contents of the mpv window, with OSD and subtitles.
        This is an alias of `scaled+subtitles+osd`.

    \<each-frame\>

    :   Take a screenshot each frame. Issue this command again to stop
        taking screenshots. Note that you should disable frame-dropping
        when using this mode - or you might receive duplicate images in
        cases when a frame was dropped. This flag can be combined with
        the other flags, e.g. `video+each-frame`.

    The exact behaviors of all flags other than `each-frame` depend on
    the selected video output.

    Older mpv versions required passing `single` and `each-frame` as
    second argument (and did not have flags). This syntax is still
    understood, but deprecated and might be removed in the future.

    If you combine this command with another one using `;`, you can use
    the `async` flag to make encoding/writing the image file
    asynchronous. For normal standalone commands, this is always
    asynchronous, and the flag has no effect. (This behavior changed
    with mpv 0.29.0.)

    On success, returns a `mpv_node` with a `filename` field set to the
    saved screenshot location.

`screenshot-to-file <filename> [<flags>]`

:   Take a screenshot and save it to a given file. The format of the
    file will be guessed by the extension (and `--screenshot-format` is
    ignored - the behavior when the extension is missing or unknown is
    arbitrary).

    The second argument is like the first argument to `screenshot` and
    supports `subtitles`, `video`, `window`.

    If the file already exists, it's overwritten.

    Like all input command parameters, the filename is subject to
    property expansion as described in [Property
    Expansion](property-expansion.md).

`screenshot-raw [<flags> [<format>]]`

:   Return a screenshot in memory. This can be used only through the
    client API or from a script using `mp.command_native`. The
    MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP returned by this command has the `w`, `h`,
    `stride` fields set to obvious contents.

    The `format` field is set to the format of the screenshot image
    data. This can be controlled by the `format` argument. The format
    can be one of the following:

    bgr0 (default)

    :   This format is organized as `B8G8R8X8` (where `B` is the LSB).
        The contents of the padding `X` are undefined.

    bgra

    :   This format is organized as `B8G8R8A8` (where `B` is the LSB).

    rgba

    :   This format is organized as `R8G8B8A8` (where `R` is the LSB).

    rgba64

    :   This format is organized as `R16G16B16A16` (where `R` is the
        LSB). Each component occupies 2 bytes per pixel. When this
        format is used, the image data will be high bit depth, and
        `--screenshot-high-bit-depth` is ignored.

    The `data` field is of type MPV_FORMAT_BYTE_ARRAY with the actual
    image data. The image is freed as soon as the result mpv_node is
    freed. As usual with client API semantics, you are not allowed to
    write to the image data.

    The `stride` is the number of bytes from a pixel at `(x0, y0)` to
    the pixel at `(x0, y0 + 1)`. This can be larger than `w * bpp` if
    the image was cropped, or if there is padding. This number can be
    negative as well. You access a pixel with
    `byte_index = y * stride + x * bpp`. Here, `bpp` is the number of
    bytes per pixel, which is 8 for `rgba64` format and 4 for other
    formats.

    The `flags` argument is like the first argument to `screenshot` and
    supports `subtitles`, `video`, `window`.

##### Filter Commands

`af <operation> <value>`

:   Change audio filter chain. See `vf` command.

`vf <operation> <value>`

:   Change video filter chain.

    The semantics are exactly the same as with option parsing (see
    [VIDEO FILTERS](../video-filters.md)). As such the text below is a
    redundant and incomplete summary.

    The first argument decides what happens:

    \<set\>

    :   Overwrite the previous filter chain with the new one.

    \<add\>

    :   Append the new filter chain to the previous one.

    \<toggle\>

    :   Check if the given filter (with the exact parameters) is already
        in the video chain. If it is, remove the filter. If it isn't,
        add the filter. (If several filters are passed to the command,
        this is done for each filter.)

        A special variant is combining this with labels, and using
        `@name` without filter name and parameters as filter entry. This
        toggles the enable/disable flag.

    \<remove\>

    :   Like `toggle`, but always remove the given filter from the
        chain.

    \<clr\>

    :   Remove all filters. Note that like the other sub-commands, this
        does not control automatically inserted filters.

    The argument is always needed. E.g. in case of `clr` use
    `vf clr ""`.

    You can assign labels to filter by prefixing them with `@name:`
    (where `name` is a user-chosen arbitrary identifier). Labels can be
    used to refer to filters by name in all of the filter chain
    modification commands. For `add`, using an already used label will
    replace the existing filter.

    The `vf` command shows the list of requested filters on the OSD
    after changing the filter chain. This is roughly equivalent to
    `show-text ${vf}`. Note that auto-inserted filters for format
    conversion are not shown on the list, only what was requested by the
    user.

    Normally, the commands will check whether the video chain is
    recreated successfully, and will undo the operation on failure. If
    the command is run before video is configured (can happen if the
    command is run immediately after opening a file and before a video
    frame is decoded), this check can't be run. Then it can happen that
    creating the video chain fails.

    <div class="admonition" markdown="1">

    Example for input.conf

    - `a vf set vflip` turn the video upside-down on the `a` key
    - `b vf set ""` remove all video filters on `b`
    - `c vf toggle gradfun` toggle debanding on `c`

    </div>

    <div class="admonition" markdown="1">

    Example how to toggle disabled filters at runtime

    - Add something like `vf-add=@deband:!gradfun` to `mpv.conf`. The
      `@deband:` is the label, an arbitrary, user-given name for this
      filter entry. The `!` before the filter name disables the filter
      by default. Everything after this is the normal filter name and
      possibly filter parameters, like in the normal `--vf` syntax.
    - Add `a vf toggle @deband` to `input.conf`. This toggles the
      "disabled" flag for the filter with the label `deband` when the
      `a` key is hit.

    </div>

`vf-command <label> <command> <argument> [<target>]`

:   Send a command to the filter. Note that currently, this only works
    with the `lavfi` filter. Refer to the libavfilter documentation for
    the list of supported commands for each filter.

    `<label>` is a mpv filter label, use `all` to send it to all filters
    at once.

    `<command>` and `<argument>` are filter-specific strings.

    `<target>` is a filter or filter instance name and defaults to
    `all`. Note that the target is an additional specifier for filters
    that support them, such as complex `lavfi` filter chains.

`af-command <label> <command> <argument> [<target>]`

:   Same as `vf-command`, but for audio filters.

##### Miscellaneous Commands

`ignore`

:   Use this to "block" keys that should be unbound, and do nothing.
    Useful for disabling default bindings, without disabling all
    bindings with `--input-default-bindings=no`.

`drop-buffers`

:   Drop audio/video/demuxer buffers, and restart from fresh. Might help
    with unseekable streams that are going out of sync. This command
    might be changed or removed in the future.

`dump-cache <start> <end> <filename>`

:   Dump the current cache to the given filename. The `<filename>` file
    is overwritten if it already exists. `<start>` and `<end>` give the
    time range of what to dump. If no data is cached at the given time
    range, nothing may be dumped (creating a file with no packets).

    Dumping a larger part of the cache will freeze the player. No effort
    was made to fix this, as this feature was meant mostly for creating
    small excerpts.

    See `--stream-record` for various caveats that mostly apply to this
    command too, as both use the same underlying code for writing the
    output file.

    If `<filename>` is an empty string, an ongoing `dump-cache` is
    stopped.

    If `<end>` is `no`, then continuous dumping is enabled. Then, after
    dumping the existing parts of the cache, anything read from network
    is appended to the cache as well. This behaves similar to
    `--stream-record` (although it does not conflict with that option,
    and they can be both active at the same time).

    If the `<end>` time is after the cache, the command will
    <span id="not">not</span>\_ wait and write newly received data to
    it.

    The end of the resulting file may be slightly damaged or incomplete
    at the end. (Not enough effort was made to ensure that the end lines
    up properly.)

    Note that this command will finish only once dumping ends. That
    means it works similar to the `screenshot` command, just that it can
    block much longer. If continuous dumping is used, the command will
    not finish until playback is stopped, an error happens, another
    `dump-cache` command is run, or an API like `mp.abort_async_command`
    was called to explicitly stop the command. See [Synchronous vs.
    Asynchronous](synchronous-vs.-asynchronous.md).

    <div class="title" markdown="1">

    Note

    </div>

    This was mostly created for network streams. For local files, there
    may be much better methods to create excerpts and such. There are
    tons of much more user-friendly Lua scripts, that will re-encode
    parts of a file by spawning a separate instance of `ffmpeg`. With
    network streams, this is not that easily possible, as the stream
    would have to be downloaded again. Even if `--stream-record` is used
    to record the stream to the local filesystem, there may be problems,
    because the recorded file is still written to.

    </div>

    This command is experimental, and all details about it may change in
    the future.

`ab-loop`

:   Cycle through A-B loop states. The first command will set the `A`
    point (the `ab-loop-a` property); the second the `B` point, and the
    third will clear both points.

`ab-loop-dump-cache <filename>`

:   Essentially calls `dump-cache` with the current AB-loop points as
    arguments. Like `dump-cache`, this will overwrite the file at
    `<filename>`. Likewise, if the B point is set to `no`, it will enter
    continuous dumping after the existing cache was dumped.

    The author reserves the right to remove this command if enough
    motivation is found to move this functionality to a trivial Lua
    script.

`ab-loop-align-cache`

:   Re-adjust the A/B loop points to the start and end within the cache
    the `ab-loop-dump-cache` command will (probably) dump. Basically, it
    aligns the times on keyframes. The guess might be off especially at
    the end (due to granularity issues due to remuxing). If the cache
    shrinks in the meantime, the points set by the command will not be
    the effective parameters either.

    This command has an even more uncertain future than
    `ab-loop-dump-cache` and might disappear without replacement if the
    author decides it's useless.

`begin-vo-dragging`

:   Begin window dragging if supported by the current VO. This command
    should only be called while a mouse button is being pressed,
    otherwise it will be ignored. The exact effect of this command
    depends on the VO implementation of window dragging. For example, on
    Windows and macOS only the left mouse button can begin window
    dragging, while X11 and Wayland allow other mouse buttons.

`context-menu`

:   Show context menu on the video window. See [Context
    Menu](../interactive-control.md#context-menu) section for details.

Undocumented commands: `ao-reload` (experimental/internal).
