title: Key names
---

All mouse and keyboard input is to converted to mpv-specific key names.
Key names are either special symbolic identifiers representing a
physical key, or text key names, which are Unicode code points encoded
as UTF-8. These are what keyboard input would normally produce, for
example `a` for the A key. These are influenced by keyboard modifiers
which affect produced text, such as shift and caps lock. As a
consequence, mpv uses input translated by the current OS keyboard
layout, rather than physical scan codes.

Currently there is the hardcoded assumption that every text key can be
represented as a single Unicode code point (in NFKC form).

All key names can be combined with the modifiers `Shift`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`,
`Meta`. They must be prefixed to the actual key name, where each
modifier is followed by a `+` (for example `ctrl+q`).

The `Shift` modifier requires some attention. In general, when the
`Shift` modifier is combined with a key which produces text, the actual
produced text key name when shift is pressed should be used.

For instance, on the US keyboard layout, `Shift+2` should usually be
specified as key-name `@` at `input.conf`, and similarly the combination
`Alt+Shift+2` is usually `Alt+@`, etc.

In general, the `Shift` modifier, when specified with text key names, is
ignored: for instance, mpv interprets `Shift+2` as `2`. The only
exceptions are ASCII letters, which are normalized by mpv. For example,
`Shift+a` is interpreted as `A`.

Special key names like `Shift+LEFT` work as expected. If in doubt - use
`--input-test` to check how a key/combination is seen by mpv.

Symbolic key names and modifier names are case-insensitive. Unicode key
names are case-sensitive just like how keyboard text input would
produce.

Another type of key names are hexadecimal key names, which start with
`0x`, followed by the hexadecimal value of the key. The hexadecimal
value can be either a Unicode code point value, or can serve as fallback
for special keys that do not have a special mpv defined name. They will
break as soon as mpv adds proper names for them, but can enable you to
use a key at all if that does not happen.

All symbolic names are listed by `--input-keylist`. `--input-test` is a
special mode that prints all input on the OSD.

Comments on some symbolic names:

`KP*`

:   Keypad names. Behavior varies by backend (whether they implement
    this, and on how they treat numlock), but typically, mpv tries to
    map keys on the keypad to separate names, even if they produce the
    same text as normal keys.

`MOUSE_BTN*`, `MBTN*`

:   Various mouse buttons.

    Depending on backend, the mouse wheel might also be represented as a
    button. In addition, `MOUSE_BTN3` to `MOUSE_BTN6` are deprecated
    aliases for `WHEEL_UP`, `WHEEL_DOWN`, `WHEEL_LEFT`, `WHEEL_RIGHT`.

    `MBTN*` are aliases for `MOUSE_BTN*`.

`WHEEL_*`

:   Mouse wheels and touch pads (typically).

    These key are scalable when used with scalable commands if the
    underlying device supports high-resolution scrolling (e.g. touch
    pads).

`AXIS_*`

:   Deprecated aliases for `WHEEL_*`.

`*_DBL`

:   Mouse button double clicks.

`MOUSE_MOVE`, `MOUSE_ENTER`, `MOUSE_LEAVE`

:   Emitted by mouse move events. Enter/leave happens when the mouse
    enters or leave the mpv window (or the current mouse region, using
    the deprecated mouse region input section mechanism).

`CLOSE_WIN`

:   Pseudo key emitted when closing the mpv window using the OS window
    manager (for example, by clicking the close button in the window
    title bar).

`GAMEPAD_*`

:   Keys emitted by the SDL gamepad backend.

`UNMAPPED`

:   Pseudo-key that matches any unmapped key. (You should probably avoid
    this if possible, because it might change behavior or get removed in
    the future.)

`ANY_UNICODE`

:   Pseudo-key that matches any key that produces text. (You should
    probably avoid this if possible, because it might change behavior or
    get removed in the future.)
