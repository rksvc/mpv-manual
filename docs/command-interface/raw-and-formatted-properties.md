title: Raw and Formatted Properties
---

Normally, properties are formatted as human-readable text, meant to be
displayed on OSD or on the terminal. It is possible to retrieve an
unformatted (raw) value from a property by prefixing its name with `=`.
These raw values can be parsed by other programs and follow the same
conventions as the options associated with the properties. Additionally,
there is a `>` prefix to format human-readable text, with fixed
precision for floating-point values. This is useful for printing values
where a constant width is important.

Examples

- `${time-pos}` expands to `00:14:23` (if playback position is at 14
  minutes 23 seconds)
- `${=time-pos}` expands to `863.4` (same time, plus 400 milliseconds -
  milliseconds are normally not shown in the formatted case)
- `${avsync}` expands to `+0.003`
- `${>avsync}` expands to `+0.0030`
- `${=avsync}` expands to `0.003028`

</div>

Sometimes, the difference in amount of information carried by raw and
formatted property values can be rather big. In some cases, raw values
have more information, like higher precision than seconds with
`time-pos`. Sometimes it is the other way around, e.g. `aid` shows track
title and language in the formatted case, but only the track number if
it is raw.
