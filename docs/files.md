Note that this section assumes Linux/BSD. On other platforms the paths
may be different. For Windows-specifics, see [FILES ON
WINDOWS](files-on-windows.md) section.

All configuration files should be encoded in UTF-8.

`/usr/local/etc/mpv/mpv.conf`

:   mpv system-wide settings (depends on `--prefix` passed to
    configure - mpv in default configuration will use
    `/usr/local/etc/mpv/` as config directory, while most Linux
    distributions will set it to `/etc/mpv/`).

`~/.cache/mpv`

:   The standard cache directory. Certain options within mpv may cause
    it to write cache files to disk. This can be overridden by
    environment variables, in ascending order:

    1
    :   If `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` is set, then the derived cache directory
        will be `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mpv`.

    2
    :   If `$MPV_HOME` is set, then the derived cache directory will be
        `$MPV_HOME`.

    If the directory does not exist, mpv will try to create it
    automatically.

`~/.config/mpv`

:   The standard configuration directory. This can be overridden by
    environment variables, in ascending order:

    1
    :   If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, then the derived configuration
        directory will be `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mpv`.

    2
    :   If `$MPV_HOME` is set, then the derived configuration directory
        will be `$MPV_HOME`.

    If this directory, nor the original configuration directory (see
    below) do not exist, mpv tries to create this directory
    automatically.

`~/.mpv/`

:   The original (pre 0.5.0) configuration directory. It will continue
    to be read if present. If this directory is present and the standard
    configuration directory is not present, then cache files and watch
    later config files will also be written to this directory.

    If both this directory and the standard configuration directory are
    present, configuration will be read from both with the standard
    configuration directory content taking precedence. However, you
    should fully migrate to the standard directory and a warning will be
    shown in this situation.

`~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf`

:   mpv user settings (see [CONFIGURATION FILES](configuration-files.md)
    section)

`~/.config/mpv/input.conf`

:   key bindings (see [INPUT.CONF](command-interface.md#inputconf) section)

`~/.config/mpv/fonts.conf`

:   Fontconfig fonts.conf that is customized for mpv. You should include
    system fonts.conf in this file or mpv would not know about fonts
    that you already have in the system.

    Only available when libass is built with fontconfig.

`~/.config/mpv/subfont.ttf`

:   fallback subtitle font

`~/.config/mpv/fonts/`

:   Default location for `--sub-fonts-dir` (see [Subtitles](options.md#subtitles))
    and `--osd-fonts-dir` (see [OSD](options.md#osd)).

`~/.config/mpv/scripts/`

:   All files in this directory are loaded as if they were passed to the
    `--script` option. They are loaded in alphabetical order.

    The `--load-scripts=no` option disables loading these files.

    See [Script location](lua-scripting.md#script-location) for details.

`~/.local/state/mpv/watch_later/`

:   Contains temporary config files needed for resuming playback of
    files with the watch later feature. See for example the `Q` key
    binding, or the `quit-watch-later` input command.

    This can be overridden by environment variables, in ascending order:

    1
    :   If `$XDG_STATE_HOME` is set, then the derived watch later
        directory will be `$XDG_STATE_HOME/mpv/watch_later`.

    2
    :   If `$MPV_HOME` is set, then the derived watch later directory
        will be `$MPV_HOME/watch_later`.

    Each file is a small config file which is loaded if the
    corresponding media file is loaded. It contains the playback
    position and some (not necessarily all) settings that were changed
    during playback. The filenames are hashed from the full paths of the
    media files. It's in general not possible to extract the media
    filename from this hash. However, you can set the
    `--write-filename-in-watch-later-config` option, and the player will
    add the media filename to the contents of the resume config file.

`~/.config/mpv/script-opts/osc.conf`

:   This is loaded by the OSC script. See the [ON SCREEN
    CONTROLLER](on-screen-controller.md) docs for details.

    Other files in this directory are specific to the corresponding
    scripts as well, and the mpv core doesn't touch them.
